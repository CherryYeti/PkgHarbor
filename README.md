# Features
- Download and unpack NoPayStation games directly to your PC

# Warning
- This code is awful, this is something I threw together because I hated having to use wine or terminal scripts to get ps3 games


# Building and Running
You need both `flatpak` and `flatpak-builder` installed.

Then, simply run the `run.sh` script located in the root folder

# Thanks
